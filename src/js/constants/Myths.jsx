    "myth": "What is this website?",
    "answer": "This is a little web app designed by [Paul](https://twitter.com/D4RK_ONION), who is an Irish Primary School teacher based in Dublin. It was inspired by a [podcast](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/anseo-s-podcast/23-myths-about-multi-denominational-schools/) by [Simon Lewis](https://twitter.com/simonmlewis) about 23 of the common misconceptions around Multi-Denominational Schools.\n\nTo use the app, simply select a myth from the menu below to see a response to it. You can also filter for certain myths using the text box at the bottom of the page. Have fun and I hope you learn something new üòÉ"

    "myth": "You can't celebrate Christmas, Easter, St. Patrick's Day or Halloween in a Multi-D School",
    "answer": "Of course you can! Multi-D schools mark these days, the only difference is that they also talk about things like Kwanzaa, Vesak or Eid. Multi-D schools mark all holidays objectively so that everyone can feel included.\n\nWinter concerts and festivals of light still happen; Easter Egg hunts and art lessons still happen; Being proud of being Irish and attending St. Patrick's Day marches still happens!\n\nAnd of course, dressing up at Halloween is not only allowed, but encouraged üéÉ"

    "myth": "There'll be no more Grandparents Day if the school changes to Multi-D",
    "answer": "There wouldn't be a 'Catholic Schools Week' Grandparents Day but that doesn't mean the new Multi-D school couldn't just run their own Grandparents Day! Not only that but every grandparent would be made to feel welcome in a Multi-D school, not just the Catholic ones.\n\nAlso did you know Catholic Schools week (and the associated 'Grandparents Day') began in 2012, shortly after the forum for Patronage & Pluralism recommended the divestment of schools away from the Catholic church? Curious ü§î"

    "myth": "With the removal of uniforms, kids will be less safe on school tours",
    "answer": "Actually Community National Schools can have uniforms, so it wouldn't be an issue for them.\n\nAs for Educate Together schools, there hasn't been a SINGLE documented case of a child going missing for any significant length of time on a school tour or trip.\n\nBesides, most kids wear their own jackets when they go on trips due to Irish weather, so teachers are well used to looking after big groups of kids that look different. ‚òîÔ∏è"

    "myth": "Students and teachers won't be able to greet each other in Irish anymore",
    "answer": "N√≠l s√© sin f√≠or ar chor ar bith! Multi-D schools use *Dia Dhuit* just like every other school in the country.\n\nIf we followed this logic, they wouldn't be able to use the word *goodbye* either, which is a contraction of *God be with you*. Words with religious origins and the multi-denominational ethos are not at odds with each other.\n\nSo *Dia Dhuit* and *Goodbye* to you üëã"

    "myth": "The school would have to change its name",
    "answer": "Yes, but it may not be as big a change as you might think.\n\nIn the case where the school is named after an area, it would simply get 'Educate Together' or 'Community' added to it. For example 'Cloontuskert National School' would become 'Cloontuskert *Community* National School' or 'Cloontuskert *Educate Together* National School'.\n\nIn the cases where there's a saint's name, it would probably be renamed after the area as above."

    "myth": "Teachers and SNAs will lose their jobs or seniority, and might even have to reinterview",
    "answer": "Schools have been divesting since 2016 now, and there isn't a single reported incident of a teacher being forced to leave a school over a reduction in numbers. Certainly all jobs and seniority would remain in place.\n\nWhat's more, the demand for Multi-D schools is so high that it's quite likely that applications to the school might increase, which would more jobs for more teachers.üë©‚Äçüè´üë®‚Äçüè´"

    "myth": "Educate Together schools don't teach Irish",
    "answer": "Of course they do! This one is just totally made up üáÆüá™\n\nThe curriculum being taught in all public Irish primary schools is **identical**. The only thing that's different is what happens during the 30 minutes a day designated as *Religion*.\n\nIn Catholic schools this time is used for faith formation. In Multi-D schools, students are taught about all religions from an objective point of view, as well as Ethics & The Environment, Equality & Justice, and Moral & Spiritual growth.\n\nYou can learn more about Educate Together's *Learn Together* curriculum [here](https://www.educatetogether.ie/app/uploads/2019/02/Learn-Together.pdf) or Community National School's *Goodness Me, Goodness You* [here](https://cns.ie/goodness-me-goodness-you-new/) üìù"

    "myth": "Multi-D schools have too many foreigners/middle class kids/working class kids/etc.",
    "answer": "There are so many 'Multi-D schools have too many X students' myths running around out there that it's honestly hard to keep them all straight in my head! üòµ\n\nMulti-D schools are as diverse as Catholic schools, both of which are full of all kinds of wonderful children just looking to get an education and feel like they belong to a community. Isn't that the most important thing about schools after all?"

    "myth": "There's no discipline or respect because children call teachers by their first name",
    "answer": "This one really seems to scare some people, but think about it; how many people in adult life do you only refer to by their surname? I can't think of a single situation where I'd feel the need to call anyone be they office worker, Garda, doctor, nurse or anyone else *Mr. Murphy* or *Ms. Foley*. It's not actually preparing children for real life and it's honestly a little old-fashioned.üßê\n\nAs for whether it helps with discipline, if it was the case that children could only be controlled because they call their teacher *Mr. Dunne*, surely there would be no discipline issues in Irish schools?\n\nDiscipline and classroom management are skills which teachers hone over the course of their career, and being called by their first name isn't going to cause a riot in the classroom!"

    "myth": "Multi-D schools are overrun with parents because of their 'open door' policy",
    "answer": "The roots of this myth seem to be from the Educate Together ethos, which state that their schools in particular must be democratically run. Parental involvement is certainly encouraged, but it has to be meaningful and have purpose. That is to say that parents are invited in if help is needed. There's no open door policy as many Irish teachers seem to think there is.\n\nIn other words, it's exactly the same as it is in Catholic schools!\n\nAlso I don't know about you, but every parent I know is extremely busy living their life and getting work done while kids are at school... Most parents don't have the time to be sitting at the back of the classroom all day, even if this was true ü§Ø"

    "myth": "Multi-D schools are anti-religion, and they don't let anyone talk about god",
    "answer": "That couldn't be further from the truth! Both Educate Together and Community National schools teach about all religions. That means that children learn about all the various gods and deities out there. All religions in the classroom are respected in Multi-D schools.\n\nWorship is what's removed from Multi-D schools. Parents who want their children to learn to worship can get together with their local parish and organise after school faith lessons. Sometimes, a teacher from the area will lead the way on this. In this way, their religion is no longer watered down to appeal to as broad a church as possible (excuse the pun) üòá"

    "myth": "Catholic schools are statistically high achieving schools academically and we shouldn't give that up",
    "answer": "This is an argument that some people make, using data from abroad. However, in those countries, Catholic schools are generally private & hard to get into. As you can imagine, most people who can afford to send their kids to schools like those are extremely well off, and thus the grades coming out of the schools tend to be higher as parents from well off families are able to give their children more advantages in life with all that extra cash üí¥\n\n However, the important thing to note here is that the academic achievements of these schools abroad is in **no way linked to catholic values**. It's linked to the vast wealth of the families attending those schools. Here in Ireland, the vast majority of students attend Catholic schools and so, their academic achievement is on average... average!"

    "myth": "My child won't be able to do their Communion or Confirmation if the school becomes Multi-D",
    "answer": "This might be the scariest myth of all, the one that puts most parents off the idea of divestment away from the church.\n\nSo let's get the easy part out of the way first. Your child **absolutely will be able to do their sacraments** if the school becomes Multi-D. No Catholic child has ever been refused a sacrament due to attending a Multi-D school. They'll still have their Communion, they'll still be able to buy a lovely suit, and they'll still be able to have a wonderful day, and they'll still be able to have an important coming of age party with their friends and family.\n\nOkay, now for the harder part. The school won't prepare them for the sacrament. **The Parish will prepare the candidates instead**. That's it. That's all that changes. Even most Catholic schools are beginning to pass sacrament preparation on to the local parish as it takes up a huge amount of teaching time. So this is something that you'll probably have to deal with regardless sooner rather than later."

    "myth": "Teachers in Multi-D schools aren't as qualified as teachers in Catholic schools",
    "answer": "There's not much to say about this one. It's nonsense. All Irish Primary School teachers have to do the same Bachelor of Education, or an equivalent Degree from abroad plus an Irish cert when they return.\n\nWithout those things, they can't get a Teaching Council number, and without that they can't teach in any public Irish primary school. End of story."

  {
    "index": 15,
    "myth": "Multi-D schools have looser teaching methodologies and class management abilities",
    "answer": "Multi-D schools aren't zoos! They're schools just like Catholic schools, and they have the same high expectations from their students. Students are expected to be polite, kind and respectful, and there are consequences for breaking rules; just like Catholic schools!\n\nJust like in Catholic schools, it comes down to the individual styles of teachers in the Multi-D school. And those teachers are trained in the exact same teacher training colleges as their Catholic school teaching peers."

    "index": 16,
    "myth": "There's no Board of Management (BOM) in Multi-D schools!/There's too many parents on the BOM in Multi-D Schools!",
    "answer": "So you can guess from the second version of this myth that the first one is just straight up wrong. Multi-D schools do of course have a Board of Management (BOM).\n\nIn fact, they have the exact same kind of BOM as Catholic Schools.\n- Two direct nominees of the patron\n- Two parents of children enrolled in the school (one mother and one father) elected by the parents\n- The principal\n- One other serving teacher elected by the teaching staff\n- Two extra members agreed by the representatives of the patron, teachers and parents\n\nYou can read more about it on the Citizen's Information page [here](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/boards_of_management.html#l4374c) (so you know it's super official and strict üò¨)"

    "myth": "There'll be lots of bullying due to students no longer wearing uniforms",
    "answer": "Actually Community National Schools can have uniforms, so it wouldn't be an issue for them.\n\nAs for Educate Together schools, it doesn't appear to be a major issue for the current ones. There's no data showing that no uniform = extra bullying, but there is [data showing that uniforms don't actually make a difference](https://ehe.osu.edu/news/listing/school-uniforms-don-t-improve-child-behavior-study-finds).\n\nBritain Malta & Ireland are the only European countries where uniforms are still worn and there aren't stories of clothing-related bullying epidemics coming out of the other European countries üìä"

    "myth": "There aren't any Multi-D secondary schools, so our kids won't be prepared for Catholic secondary school.",
    "answer": "Firstly, and I hate to be that guy, but there are [22 Educate Together secondary schools](https://www.educatetogether.ie/second-level-schools-search/) and [205 English speaking Community Colleges](https://www.etbi.ie/community-colleges/) in Ireland.\n\nBut yes, realistically, your child may still end up attending a Catholic secondary school. So how will they possibly transition after 8 years in a Multi-D school? Well the Educate Together body commissioned a study on the welfare of children transitioning from ET Primary to Catholic secondary. The study found that there were no issues whatsoever for those students!"

    "index": 19,
    "myth": "Without the Catholic religion, children won't learn right from wrong",
    "answer": "The Catholic mantra of 'Treat others as you would like others to treat you' is a good one, and students do learn morality from their catholic education. However, this is not exclusive to the Catholic religion!\n\nIt's called [The Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) and it is observed by almost every religion on the planet. In other words: Morality, Being Good, and Doing the Right Thing do not exclusively belong to Catholics. Every religion including those far far older than Catholicism uses the Golden Rule. Isn't it wonderful that people all throughout history from all corners of the globe have an innate sense to look after those around them and treat them well? It gives me a lot of hope üôè\n\nAll that aside, Multi-D schools (ET and CNS) both teach about Morality and Ethics during the 30 minutes a day allocated to religion, and they teach SPHE exactly the same as Catholic schools (which includes many lessons about being a good friend and a good citizen)."
