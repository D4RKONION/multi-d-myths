# Multi-D Myths

Multi-D Myths is a web app styled as a text conversation dedicated to dispelling certain myths about Multi-Denominational Schools. It was inspired by a [podcast](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/anseo-s-podcast/23-myths-about-multi-denominational-schools/) by [Simon Lewis](https://twitter.com/simonmlewis) about 23 of the common misconceptions around [Multi-Denominational Schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidenominational_school?useskin=vector).

Thank you also to [Jana](https://twitter.com/muinteoirjana) and Simon for their excellent proof-reading and contributions to answers.
